# Contributing

## Creating new Pull Request
* Remember to add appropriate description and title according based on the following pattern:  
`[#ISSUE_NUMBER] Short description`
* One pull request should always address one issue or feature
* Adding video or screenshot is very beneficial, but it's not mandatory
* After merging the pull request, remember to close the linked issue if it has been resolved

## Code Style
* Make sure your code is meeting the default [Ktlint standards](https://ktlint.github.io/#rules) (except for wildcard imports)
* Name the branch according to your ticket, following this pattern: #issue_number-short_description
